# OldPodcastScheduler

Do you have a favorite podcast that's been around for a while and you started listening in the middle?
Or is there a lecture series that you want to listen to that is available as an RSS feed?
Do you want your podcast app to automatically download episode or lectures on a schedule.

The basic idea is to paste the RSS url into this scheduler and it gives you a url to give to your podcast app.
It's currently intended to be deployed to Heroku for personal use.

# TODO

1. Code to parse an RSS feed and store in a database
2. Code to retrieve entries and serve the modified RSS feed
